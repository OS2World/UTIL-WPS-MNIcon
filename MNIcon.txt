MNIcon - enhanced icon class for the Workplace Shell (release 2: 02/09/96)

"MNIcon" class is a replacement for the default "WPIcon" class.  It adds 
'drag & drop' functionality to the icon class so that, to set the icon of an 
object, you can simply drag and drop it on an icon file (*.ICO).

The archive contains the following files:

    MNIcon.doc   this file
    MNIcon.c     class source
    MNIcon.csc   SOM class definition
    MNIcon.dll   class dll
    install.cmd  installation script
    uninst.cmd   uninstallation script
    repclass.exe WPS class replacement utility

This program is in public domain.

1.  Installation

    1) copy MNIcon.dll to a directory listed in your LIBPATH (e.g.,
    C:\OS2\DLL);

    2) execute "install.cmd" script;

    3) reboot the system.

2.  Uninstallation

    1) execute "uninst.cmd" script;
    
    2) reboot the system.

3.  Usage

    To set the icon of an (non-icon) object to the icon of a *.ICO file,

        1) open a view of the folder containing the *.ICO file so that you can
        see the icon;

        2) drag the object and drop it on the icon of the *.ICO file.

    You can drop multiple objects on an icon.

    You cannot drop a *.ICO icon file object on another *.ICO icon file object.

4.  Compilation

    This program is compiled with IBM C Set/2 (with ToolKit).  To re-build,
    type "nmake -f MNIcon.mak".

5.  Notes

    The 'association' trick used in version 1.0 doesn't work any more with
    Warp, so this version uses simpler 'class replacement' method.

    Some extended attributes (EA) may be added by the system to the *.ICO files
    (marking them as instances of 'MNIcon' class).  This may cause problems
    when the *.ICO files with this EA is copied to a system without MNIcon.
    If you experience problems, remove the EAs using the 'EAUTIL' utility 
    (regular *.ICO files don't have any EA); e.g., to remove EAs from all 
    *.ICO files in the current directory, type something like:

        for %f in (*.ICO) do EAUTIL %f NUL /S

    This program is tested on OS/2 Warp (with FixPack 17).
    Although the program seems working so far, please use it at your own risk.
